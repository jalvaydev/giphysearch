## giphysearch


A small side project built to learn how to build applications that use infinite scroll. Styling
was not a priority in this project.

Provide your API key in a `.env` in the project directory and run `npm run dev` to start the server.


### Goals

1. Display the trending GIFs on Giphy on page load.
2. Search bar to search for a specific query, if cleared display the trending GIFs again.
3. On scrolling to the bottom of the page, fetch the next set of GIFs.
